### Known issues
- Installing ExtremeVoiceEngine and using a command in Xion while enable Xion, which is displayed as "invalid command".
  - This issue is a display issue that occurs in connection with the implementation of separate command processing in ExtremeVoiceEngine and ExtremeRoles, so it has no effect on operation.
