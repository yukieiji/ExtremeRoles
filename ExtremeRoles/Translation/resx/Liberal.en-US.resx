    <value>Type: Dove/Militant (depending on settings)
Considered a Dove if tasks are assigned, and a Militant if a kill button is assigned.

Current funds are displayed next to the player's name.
This role always exists when the Liberal faction is assigned.
This role cannot be targeted by abilities under any circumstances.
If "Allow Kills on Leader" is OFF, all kills against the Leader are invalidated.
Behavior changes with the following settings:
- If "Allow Kills when Liberal faction is only the Leader" is ON, the Leader can be killed when they are the last remaining member of the Liberal faction.
- If "Auto-Eliminate when Liberal faction is only the Leader" is ON, the Leader automatically dies when they are the last remaining member of the Liberal faction. Auto-revival will not occur in this case.

Settings labeled "Fund Increase Rate Increase" permanently increase the multiplier for funds gained by all Liberal faction members when the Leader enters specific situations.
Example:
"Militant - Fund Increase Rate Increase per Kill": 5
"Leader - Fund Increase Rate Increase per Kill": 10
"Leader - Fund Bonus per Kill": 10%
1. When the Leader starts killing, the fund increase rate increases by 10%, and funds increase by 11 (10 * 1.1).
2. Subsequently, when a Liberal Militant kills, funds increase by 5.5 (5 * 1.1).</value>
